Changelog
=========

V0.3.5 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Update 5):
- Updated the timing of the RX/TX switching to exactly match the start of timeslot window.
<work in progress>

V0.3.4 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Update 4):
- Cleanup.
- Additional stuff by Roger Clark, VK3KYY / G4KYF and Colin Durbridge, G4EML:
  - Changes for All Channels Zone and Direct Channel Access. (Colin Durbridge, G4EML)
  - Change CTCSS Selection Method: Select CTCSS Tones from a list of valid tones. (Colin Durbridge, G4EML)
  - Fix for EEPROM write delay problem, from Colin G4EML. Removed the 5ms delay after EEPROM write in fw_usb_com.c as that should now also be redundant.
  - Fix for menu system data inconsistency.
  - Added hotspot mode (work in progress), currently disabled.
  - Added USB_DEBUG_PRINT.

V0.3.3 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Update 3):
- Additional stuff by Roger Clark, VK3KYY / G4KYF:
  - Fix issue with incorrect maximum number of channels per zone.
  - Improvement for bug when number of Zones is less than 3 (which is the number of lines on the screen). Note this is not the ideal fix in terms of GUI design, but is better than it was before.
  - Bug fix from Colin G4ELM for the FM green Rx led permanently on, sometimes when switching from DMR to FM.
  - Add Tx timeout, from value in the codeplug. Tx timer now counts up if TOT is not defined or down from the TOT value is it is defined, and Tx is terminated after the timeout period.

V0.3.2 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Update 2):
- Fixed a bug where DMR RX stopped working due to internally incorrect bandwidth handling.
- Reset HR-C6000 state every time when calibration is done (this avoids affected FM mode after DMR TX).
- Silence packets at end of transmission to avoid "TX blip".

V0.3.1 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Update 1):
- Cleanup / comments / refactoring.
- VFO screen should have the same initialization order as channel screen.
- Fixed some AT1846S settings.
- Take care of bandwidth for filter_band_sel + band_mode_sel in trxSetFrequency.
- Take care of bandwidth for modu_det_sel (SQ setting) in FM mode.
- Take care of mode for dac_vgain_analog and volume_analog.
- Take care of bandwidth for xmitter_dev, noise1_th, noise2_th, rssi3_th and squelch_th.
- Cleanup AT1846FMSettings from values that get set elsewhere, reordered remaining AT1846FMSettings and AT1846DMRSettings.
- Added DMR mode specific modu_det_sel (SQ setting) to AT1846DMRSettings.
- Added DMR mode specific FM deviation to AT1846DMRSettings.
- Additional stuff by Roger Clark, VK3KYY / G4KYF:
  - More improvements to Green key on menu screens.
  - Fix for bug #29.
  - Update name in comm port driver, to OpenGD77.
  - Changed frequency range checking, so that Rx freq is only limited to the radio hardware limits, but Tx is limited to Amateur bands (in menuTxScreen.c).

V0.3 (OpenGD77 Phase 1):
- Additional stuff by Roger Clark, VK3KYY / G4KYF:
  - Added battery percentage display to VFO and Channel screens and made changes elsewhere to support this, including menuBattery.c.
  - Add squelch to the nonVolatileSettings and use it in fw_trx.c.
  - Fix bug where mode changes, via the star button, on both the Channel and VFO screen are reverted after the end of the next transmission.
  - Improve menu system by returning to the home screen in most screens when the green button is pressed.

-----------------------------------

V0.2.4 (OpenGD77 Phase 1 - Release Candidate 1):

- Additional stuff by Roger Clark, VK3KYY / G4KYF:
  - Added FontConverter source and binary, to convert RaysFontEditor 8x16 bitmap fonts, for use with the UC1701 display. Note: The converter needs to be improved to handle other font sizes.

  - Improved FM Rx filter settings from Colin G4EML.
  - Add Colin G4EML to the credits screen.
  - Fix problem if when the firmware is initially run, VFO A is set to FM Analog and may have invalid DMR setting, also fixed a related problem to initial freq being set to 400Mhz as this is the CPS VFO default.
  - Add support for FM Rx/TxCTCSS, from Colin G4EML.
  - Use PIT on Tx Screen to fix time keeping, and also change counter to count up instead of down.
  - Add support for 25 or 12.5kHz bandwidth on analogue / FM.
  - Fix warning about implicit declaration of trxSetTxCTCSS().
  - In Analog mode, turn on the green LED and also the backlight when there is a signal is received.

  - Add Utilities menu option to enable or disable the calibration system.
  - Swap position of Tx and Rx freqs on the VFO screen.

  - Fix problem where DMR Rx would not work after transmitting in DMR mode.
  - Limit power setting to value of 2000 which equates to approximately 4W. Also don't immediately set the DAC output power level when setting the Tx power, because its possible that the DAC power level control voltage should be zero when not transmitting.
